## Arrays
In most programming languages, an array is a collection of elements. Arrays allow us to store more than one value in a single variable.

**Note**: The PHP opening and closing tags are left out in all code examples below. Assume the code is inside PHP tags `<?php ?>`.

Here's how an array is described in PHP.

* An `array` has `elements` separated by commas
* An `array element` has a `key` and a `value`

Let me explain what this means.

This is an array with 3 array elements (dog, cat and rabbit).

```php
$animals = array( 'dog', 'cat', 'rabbit' );
```

This array has no array keys. PHP sees arrays without keys as if it has numbered array keys. In this example PHP sees the array like this (with array keys 0, 1 and 2).

```php
$animals = array(
	0 => 'dog',
	1 => 'cat',
	2 => 'rabbit',
);
```

Arrays with **only** numbered keys are called `numerical arrays`. For convenience we don't have to add the numbered keys for numerical arrays. We could add the numbered keys ourself if we wanted the numbered keys to be different.

As you can see, the format for array elements in PHP is `key => value` with the `=>` part seperating the key from the value. It's also allowed to have a comma after the last element (see `2 => 'rabbit',` in the code above).

In PHP lingo we can now say "The first element of this array has array key `0` with the array value `dog`."

**Note**: In most programming languages counting starts from 0.

Arrays with no elements are also allowed. We call this an `empty array`.

```php
$empty_array = array();
```

Empty arrays are often used to add values to it later.

#### Keys and Values 

* `Array keys` can either be (whole) numbers (starting from zero), or strings. 
* `Array values` can be of any type. You already know the types `string`, `number`, and now `array`. More value types are explained later.

**Note**: In PHP (and in math) we call whole numbers (without any decimal part) `integers`.

#### Adding Values to Numerical Arrays
By adding empty square brackets `[]` after an `array variable` you can add a new value to it.

```php
$animals = array( 'dog', 'cat', 'rabbit' );

// Adding the 'chicken' value to the array
$animals[] = 'chicken';
```

This is how PHP sees the value of the `$animals` variable after adding the `chicken` value to it.

```php
array(
	0 => 'dog',
	1 => 'cat',
	2 => 'rabbit',
	3 => 'chicken',
);
```
As you can see, it was added at the end. We can now say, "The last array element has array key `3` with array value `chicken`.

#### Accessing Values from Numerical Arrays

Use an existing array key inside the square brackets to access a value from a numerical array. 

```php
$animals = array( 'dog', 'cat', 'rabbit' );

// Getting the first value from the array.
$first_value = $animals[0];

echo "The first array value is {$first_value}";
```

This will display `The first array value is dog`. Remember, PHP sees arrays without array keys as an array with numbered keys (starting from zero).

#### Using Your Own Array Keys

As youâ€™ve seen, array keys can be integers or strings. Let's see how an array with our own (string) array keys looks like.

```php
$colors = array( 
	'grass' => 'green',
	'sky'   => 'blue',
);
```
For this array we can say, "The first array element has array key `grass` with array value `green`".

If **all or one** array key is a string we call it an `associative array`.

#### Adding Values to Associative Arrays

Use a unique array key inside square brackets to add a new value to the array.

```php
$colors = array( 
	'grass' => 'green',
	'sky'   => 'blue',
);

// Adding a value to the (new) 'firetruck' key
$colors['firetruck'] = 'red';
```

This is the value of the `$colors` variable after adding a value for the `firetruck` array key

```php
array( 
	'grass'     => 'green',
	'sky'       => 'blue',
	'firetruck' => 'red',
);
```

You can see the `firetruck` key with value `red` was added to the array.
#### Accessing Values from Associative Arrays

Use an existing array key inside square brackets to access a value from an associative array.

```php
$colors = array( 
	'grass' => 'green',
	'sky'   => 'blue',
);

// Getting the value for the 'sky' array key.
$sky_color = $colors['sky'];

echo "The sky is {$sky_color}";
```

This code will display `the sky is blue`

#### Updating Array Values.
Use an existing array key inside square brackets to update array values.

```php
$colors = array( 
	'grass' => 'green',
	'sky'   => 'blue',
);

// Updating the sky array key value
$colors['sky'] = 'gray';

echo "The sky is {$colors['sky']}";
```

This code will display `the sky is gray`

#### Arrays Containing Arrays
Array keys can also have arrays as their value. Let's see how that looks like.

```php
$animals = array(
	'dog' => array(
		'name' => 'Max',
		'age'  => 3,
	),
	'cat' => array(
		'name' => 'Lucy',
		'age'  => 8,
	),
);
```

Arrays containing other arrays are called `multidimensional arrays`. The arrays inside a multidimensional array are called `nested arrays`.

#### Adding Values to a Nested Array
Use an existing array key inside square brackets to target the nested array (you want to update). Add square brackets with a unique new key right after it to add a value. 


```php
$animals = array(
	'dog' => array(
		'name' => 'Max',
		'age'  => 3,
	),
	'cat' => array(
		'name' => 'Lucy',
		'age'  => 8,
	),
);
 
// Update the "dog" array with a new array element.
$animals['dog']['toy'] = 'tennisball';
```

This is the value of the `$animals` varable after updating it with the new `toy` key.

```php
array(
	'dog' => array(
		'name' => 'Max',
		'age'  => 3,
		'toy'  => 'tennisbal',
	),
	'cat' => array(
		'name' => 'Lucy',
		'age'  => 8,
	),
);
```
As you can see the new `toy` key with the value `tennisball` is added to the `dog` array.

#### Accessing Values from a Multidimensional Array
(Todo)

To recap.

* Arrays allow us to store more than one value in a single variable
* Arrays have elements separated by commas
* Array elements have a key and a value
* The format for array elements in PHP is `key => value`
* Empty arrays have no array elements
* It's allowed to have a comma after the last array element
* Integers are whole numbers without any decimal part
* Most programming languages start counting from 0
* Array keys can either be integers (starting from zero), or strings
* Array values can be of any type (including strings, numbers or arrays)
* Numerical arrays have only numbered keys
* Associative arrays have one or more (or only) string keys
* Multidimensional arrays are arrays containing one or more arrays
* Nested arrays are the arrays inside a multidimensional array.
* It's allowed to leave the array keys out in numerical array elements.
* Square brackets (after an array variable) are used to add or access array values
* Use an existing array key inside square brackets to update array values
* Use a unique array key inside square brackets to add a new value to an array.
